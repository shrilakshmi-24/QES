# QES
This project is based on Web Development And its Applications. The main objective of this project is to learn the implementation of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The basic webpage of this project is created using HTML and styling of the webpage is done using CSS.  QES is a question and answer website for Engineering students. We tend to create flagship site similar to the Stack Overflow Site of the Stack Exchange Network, created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. QES features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in Engineering. Our notion of a better-connected engineering community to tackle all kinds of academic and non Academical questions and problems would make the engineering community better. Establishing a community based platform like this would help bypass the location barrier for Engineering students.
